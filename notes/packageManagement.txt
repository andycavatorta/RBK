? how to call git only on upgrade ?
? how to automatically signal version upgrade if not through git ?
----------------------

package manage is called on start

git pull

get new software version number from setting.json
get present software version number from local pickle

if new version number is higher
    open versionScripts.py - bash scripts wrapped in py dict, keyed by version number
    create list of executable scripts
        order by version numbers
        remove all scripts numbers equal to or lower than the current version
    execute version scripts in order
        scripts must run with permissions in 'yes' or 'auto' mode
        all script output must be written to a log file for this version number
    main server will automatically gather log files *sometime*
    update pickle with version number



sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y
sudo python /home/pi/RBK/common/configuremojo.py -v -n -d=/dev/mojo -i=/home/pi/RBK/fpga/mojo-base-project-master-sig-gen/syn/mojo_top.bin
