    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:     32
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:        32
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   774 out of   1,430   54%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                     2,048 out of   2,860   71%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        2,737
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,781 out of   2,737   65%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              98 out of  11,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
