      Number using O6 output only:           1,110
      Number using O5 output only:             312
      Number using O5 and O6:                  792

    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   1,440    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:     13
      Number with same-slice register load:      1
      Number with same-slice carry load:        12
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   615 out of   1,430   43%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                     1,552 out of   2,860   54%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        2,268
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,495 out of   2,268   65%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  41 out of   2,268    1%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         732 out of   2,268   32%
    Number of unique control sets:              12
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              42 out of  11,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
