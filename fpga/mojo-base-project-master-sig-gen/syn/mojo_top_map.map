    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   1,440    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:     34
      Number with same-slice register load:     20
      Number with same-slice carry load:        14
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   721 out of   1,430   50%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                     2,088 out of   2,860   73%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        2,736
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,869 out of   2,736   68%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 335 out of   2,736   12%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         532 out of   2,736   19%
    Number of unique control sets:              17
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              65 out of  11,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
